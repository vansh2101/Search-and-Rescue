# Search and Rescue
This is the project for UAS-DTU 2nd round. This project uses Autonomous image segmentation and feature detection and classification using the OpenCV library which takes images as an input and filters out the burnt and unburnt area, figures out the number of houses and calculates the priority ratio and sorts the images according to it.

## Task
The theme for this task is Search and Rescue. A fire has broken out in a civilian area and your job is to gather information about the location of houses and buildings in the area. Your UAV is collecting images of the search area that look like the sample image.

## Information about the input image
1) The brown area is burnt grass
2) The green area is unburnt grass
3) The blue and red triangles are houses
4) Each house colour has an associated priority
5) Blue house have a priority of 2
6) Red houses have a priority of 1

## Libraries used
1) OpenCV
2) Numpy
3) Glob

## How to run it
1) Clone the repository
2) Run `main.py`
